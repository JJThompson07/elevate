Incline fly,"The incline dumbbell flye, unlike the flat dumbell fly, targets the top area of the pecs, most significantly the sternal fibres – those that attach directly to your sternum. Growth in this particular area creates the defined “chest separation” look. The move is also better at stimulating chest fibres across the spectrum than the flat bench press.","Hold a dumbbell on each hand and lie on an incline bench that is set to an incline angle of no more than 30 degrees.
Extend your arms above you with a slight bend at the elbows.
Now rotate the wrists so that the palms of your hands are facing you. Tip: The pinky fingers should be next to each other. This will be your starting position.
As you breathe in, start to slowly lower the arms to the side while keeping the arms extended and while rotating the wrists until the palms of the hand are facing each other. Tip: At the end of the movement the arms will be by your side with the palms facing the ceiling.
As you exhale start to bring the dumbbells back up to the starting position by reversing the motion and rotating the hands so that the pinky fingers are next to each other again. Tip: Keep in mind that the movement will only happen at the shoulder joint and at the wrist. There is no motion that happens at the elbow joint.
Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.",Pectoralis major,Chest,Hypertrophy,Free weight
Flat fly,"The dumbbell flye targets all areas of the pecs, but most significantly the sternal fibres – those that attach directly to your sternum. Growth in this particular area creates the defined “chest separation” look. The move is also better at stimulating chest fibres across the spectrum than the flat bench press.","Lie down on a flat bench with a dumbbell on each hand resting on top of your thighs. The palms of your hand will be facing each other.
Then using your thighs to help raise the dumbbells, lift the dumbbells one at a time so you can hold them in front of you at shoulder width with the palms of your hands facing each other. Raise the dumbbells up like you're pressing them, but stop and hold just before you lock out. This will be your starting position.
With a slight bend on your elbows in order to prevent stress at the biceps tendon, lower your arms out at both sides in a wide arc until you feel a stretch on your chest. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Keep in mind that throughout the movement, the arms should remain stationary; the movement should only occur at the shoulder joint.
Return your arms back to the starting position as you squeeze your chest muscles and breathe out. Tip: Make sure to use the same arc of motion used to lower the weights.
Hold for a second at the contracted position and repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.",Pectoralis major,Chest,Hypertrophy,Free weight
Cable row,The seated cable row develops the muscles of the back and the forearms. It is an excellent all-around compound exercise for developing mainly the middle back while offering useful arm work as well. It's considered a beginner's level exercise. Here's a step by step how-to.,"For this exercise you will need access to a low pulley row machine with a V-bar. Note: The V-bar will enable you to have a neutral grip where the palms of your hands face each other. To get into the starting position, first sit down on the machine and place your feet on the front platform or crossbar provided making sure that your knees are slightly bent and not locked.
Lean over as you keep the natural alignment of your back and grab the V-bar handles.
With your arms extended pull back until your torso is at a 90-degree angle from your legs. Your back should be slightly arched and your chest should be sticking out. You should be feeling a nice stretch on your lats as you hold the bar in front of you. This is the starting position of the exercise.
Keeping the torso stationary, pull the handles back towards your torso while keeping the arms close to it until you touch the abdominals. Breathe out as you perform that movement. At that point you should be squeezing your back muscles hard. Hold that contraction for a second and slowly go back to the original position while breathing in.
Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.",Latissimus dorsi,Back,Strength,Cable
Wide grip pull down,"The pulldown exercise is performed at a workstation with adjustable resistance, usually plates. While sitting with your upper thighs restrained under a thigh pad, you pull a hanging bar down toward you, with hands as far apart as possible, to reach chin level, and then release it back up with control for one repetition.","Sit down on a pull-down machine with a wide bar attached to the top pulley. Make sure that you adjust the knee pad of the machine to fit your height. These pads will prevent your body from being raised by the resistance attached to the bar.
Grab the bar with the palms facing forward using the prescribed grip. Note on grips: For a wide grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance wider than shoulder width. For a medium grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance equal to your shoulder width and for a close grip at a distance smaller than your shoulder width.
As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, bring your torso back around 30 degrees or so while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position.
As you breathe out, bring the bar down until it touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work except for holding the bar; therefore do not try to pull down the bar using the forearms.
After a second at the contracted position squeezing your shoulder blades together, slowly raise the bar back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched. Inhale during this portion of the movement.
Repeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.",Teres major,Back,Hypertrophy,Cable
Close grip pull down,"The close pulldown exercise is performed at a workstation with adjustable resistance, usually plates. While sitting with your upper thighs restrained under a thigh pad, you pull a hanging bar down toward you with hands shoulder width apart, to reach chin level, and then release it back up with control for one repetition.","Sit down on a pull-down machine with a wide bar attached to the top pulley.

For a medium grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance equal to your shoulder width and for a close grip at a distance smaller than your shoulder width.
As you have both arms extended in front of you - while holding the bar at the chosen grip width - bring your torso back around 30 degrees or so while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position.
As you breathe out, bring the bar down until it touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary (only the arms should move). The forearms should do no other work except for holding the bar; therefore do not try to pull the bar down using the forearms.

Lat pull down,"The lat pulldown exercise works the back muscles, especially the latissimus dorsi or the ""lats,"" the muscle just under the armpits and spreading across and down the back. By isolating the back muscles with this exercise, you can focus specifically on this group of muscles, without tiring out the biceps or triceps.","You will start by grabbing the wide bar from the top pulley of a pulldown machine and using a wider than shoulder-width pronated (palms down) grip. Step backwards two feet or so.
Bend your torso forward at the waist by around 30-degrees with your arms fully extended in front of you and a slight bend at the elbows. If your arms are not fully extended then you need to step a bit more backwards until they are. Once your arms are fully extended and your torso is slightly bent at the waist, tighten the lats and then you are ready to begin.
While keeping the arms straight, pull the bar down by contracting the lats until your hands are next to the side of the thighs. Breathe out as you perform this step.
While keeping the arms straight, go back to the starting position while breathing in.
Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.",Latissimus dorsi,Back,Hypertrophy,Cable
Barbell pull over,"The barbell pull over isolates the bak, specifically the lats, with a workout in close description to the opposite of a straight arm pull down","Lie on a flat bench with a barbell using a shoulder grip width.
Hold the bar straight over your chest with a bend in your arms. This will be your starting position.
While keeping your arms in the bent arm position, lower the weight slowly in an arc behind your head while breathing in until you feel a stretch on the chest.
At that point, bring the barbell back to the starting position using the arc through which the weight was lowered and exhale as you perform this movement.
Hold the weight on the initial position for a second and repeat the motion for the prescribed number of repetitions.",Latissimus dorsi,Back,Hypertrophy,Free weight
Barbell rollout,"To build a rock-hard six-pack you need to push your abs muscles to the limit to force them to grow, and there are few exercises that test your core as hard as the abs roll-out. It’s a tough move, but as with all exercises – and especially the advanced ones – the more effort you put in, the quicker and more impressive the results will be.","Hold an Olympic barbell loaded with 5-10lbs on each side and kneel on the floor.
Now place the barbell on the floor in front of you so that you are on all your hands and knees (as in a kneeling push up position). This will be your starting position.
Slowly roll the barbell straight forward, stretching your body into a straight position. Tip: Go down as far as you can without touching the floor with your body. Breathe in during this portion of the movement.
After a second pause at the stretched position, start pulling yourself back to the starting position as you breathe out. Tip: Go slowly and keep your abs tight at all times.",Rectus abdominis,core,Hypertrophy,Bodyweight
Landmine chest press,"A well developed chest is a must-have for a symmetrical, balanced upper body musculature. We’ve all noticed that having a weak chest is as detrimental to the overall appearance as having a weak back – almost no one could admire a guy who sports pumped arms and chiseled abs with a relatively flat chest seated in the middle.","Grab the bar with both hands right at the end
Put your hands together to create a solid base
Slightly leaning towards the bar start pushing it away from you
During the whole time keep the chest tight, elbows tucked in together and shoulders back.",Pectoralis major,Chest,Hypertrophy,Free weight
Landmine shoulder press,"The landmine press is a unique unilateral overhead pressing movement that can increase movement asymmetries, build scapular strength and stability, and improve overall health and development of the shoulder. In this landmine press guide we will discuss:","With the single-arm landmine press it’s best to adopt a split stance
With the opposite leg to the arm you are lifting with forwards.
Press the weight up with one arm, keeping it in line with your shoulder rather than moving it towards the middle of your body.
Single-arm landmine presses work the shoulder harder than two-handed presses, which are more focused on the chest.",Deltoids,Shoulders,Hypertrophy,Free weight
Butterfly,"Also known as Pec deck, the butterfly uses the machine flys to isolate the pecs on a controlled squeeze through a limited range of motion and a supported core.","Sit on the machine with your back flat on the pad.
Take hold of the handles. Tip: Your upper arms should be positioned parallel to the floor; adjust the machine accordingly. This will be your starting position.
Push the handles together slowly as you squeeze your chest in the middle. Breathe out during this part of the motion and hold the contraction for a second.
Return back to the starting position slowly as you inhale until your chest muscles are fully stretched.
Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.",Pectoralis major,Chest,Eccentric,Cable
EZ reverse grip row,"Similar to the reverse grip barbell bent over row, the EZ reverse grip bent over row applies a more nuetral grip of the bar due to its shape, allowing for a more controlled and natural feeling variation","Stand erect while holding a barbell with a supinated grip (palms facing up).
Bend your knees slightly and bring your torso forward, by bending at the waist, while keeping the back straight until it is almost parallel to the floor. Tip: Make sure that you keep the head up. The barbell should hang directly in front of you as your arms hang perpendicular to the floor and your torso. This is your starting position.
While keeping the torso stationary, lift the barbell as you breathe out, keeping the elbows close to the body and not doing any force with the forearm other than holding the weights. On the top contracted position, squeeze the back muscles and hold for a second.

Machine reverse fly,"Reverse flys, also spelled flyes or flies, target the muscles on the back of the shoulders. The posterior deltoids are the main muscles on the back of the shoulders. Reverse flys also work the muscles of the upper and middle back, particularly the rhomboids and traps. Bodybuilders can perform reverse flys with dumbbells, resistance bands and a cable machine. Because bodybuilding requires lifting heavy weights to stimulate muscle growth, heavy dumbbells, a machine or thick, heavy resistance bands are necessary.","Adjust the handles so that they are fully to the rear. Make an appropriate weight selection and adjust the seat height so the handles are at shoulder level. Grasp the handles with your hands facing inwards. This will be your starting position.
In a semicircular motion, pull your hands out to your side and back, contracting your rear delts.
Keep your arms slightly bent throughout the movement, with all of the motion occurring at the shoulder joint.
Pause at the rear of the movement, and slowly return the weight to the starting position.",Deltoids,Shoulders,Eccentric,Cable
Cable push down,"The triceps pushdown is one of the best exercises for triceps development. Variations include grip position and a rope handle instead of the horizontal bar. Done properly, this one really burns.","Attach a straight or angled bar to a high pulley and grab with an overhand grip (palms facing down) at shoulder width.
Standing upright with the torso straight and a very small inclination forward, bring the upper arms close to your body and perpendicular to the floor. The forearms should be pointing up towards the pulley as they hold the bar. This is your starting position.
Using the triceps, bring the bar down until it touches the front of your thighs and the arms are fully extended perpendicular to the floor. The upper arms should always remain stationary next to your torso and only the forearms should move. Exhale as you perform this movement.

Rope tricep extension,"Overhead cable tricep extensions are a great isolation movement for developing your triceps. In particular, using a rope attachment places more emphasis on the lateral (outside) head of the tricep.","Attach a rope to a low pulley. After selecting an appropriate weight, grasp the rope with both hands and face away from the cable.
Position your hands behind your head with your elbows point straight up. Your elbows should start out flexed, and you can stagger your stance and lean gently away from the machine to create greater stability. This will be your starting position.
To perform the movement, extend through the elbow while keeping the upper arm in position, raising your hands above your head.
Squeeze your triceps at the top of the movement, and slowly lower the weight back to the start position.",Triceps Brachii,Arms,Hypertrophy,Cable
EZ bicep curl,"An EZ-bar curl is, well, easy. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent. Hold an EZ-bar in an underhand grip with your arms extended and then curl the bar up towards your chest, keeping your elbows in to your sides. But it’s also easy to get the finer points wrong – nail your form with these tips.","Stand up straight while holding an EZ curl bar at the wide outer handle. The palms of your hands should be facing forward and slightly tilted inward due to the shape of the bar. Keep your elbows close to your torso. This will be your starting position.

Piston squat,"It’s probably not a surprise that squatting on one leg is harder than two legs. But what might be surprising is that it’s not just twice as hard—it’s more like three or four times harder. That is, if you’re talking about the pistol squat, a single-leg variation of the squat in which hold your non-working leg straight and parallel to the floor.

Compared to the standard squat, pistol squats are more taxing on your nervous system, lower-body muscles, and your core. ","From a standing position, raise one foot off the floor. You should be looking directly forward, with your chest up, knees and hips slightly bent, and your back straight. This will be your starting position.
Descend into a squat by flexing your hips and knee. As you squat, extend the non-working leg forward to allow clearance for your movement. Descend slowly, paying close attention to balance and proper movement mechanics, going as far as your flexibility allows.
